This project is a complete **web dashboard platform**, developed from scratch, that allows users to:

- Enroll in new courses
- Track learning progress and statistics
- Access quizzes
- Update their personal data and password

## ✨ What does the dashboard include?

The interface includes several main sections:

- **Header** with the user’s name and quick access to profile
- **Sidebar** for navigation (courses, stats, settings, quizzes)
- **“Go Premium” card** to promote premium features
- **Available courses list** dynamically loaded from the database
- **Current course section** showing enrolled course details
- **Progress indicator** with a “Continue” button
- **Quizzes** linked to each course

The entire layout is **fully responsive**, meaning it works perfectly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices 📱💻.

## 🛠️ How was it built?

This project was developed using modern web development tools. Every part of the system was created with a real-world app structure in mind:

1. **Design based on Figma mockups:** Layouts, spacing, and styling follow a professional visual design.
2. **Built with React and Tailwind CSS:** Every section of the dashboard (header, sidebar, etc.) was implemented as clean, reusable components.
3. **Connected to a PocketBase database:** All courses, enrollments, user data, and progress are stored and retrieved from a real backend.
4. **User logic included:** Features like login, profile editing, password change, course enrollment, and progress tracking are implemented.
5. **Dynamic data loading:** Courses and quizzes are fetched live from the database, not hardcoded.
6. **Complete front-end logic:** Though it’s a frontend app, it behaves like a real full-featured learning platform.
